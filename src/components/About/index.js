                    <p>Hi, I'm Rabia Eda YÄ±lmaz and currently a 4th year undergrad Biomedical Engineering
                    student. Reading books and doing art are part of my life. Linguistics has always been
                    a big interest for me. I have interacted with mid-level Russian and Japanese, except my
                    so-believed advanced English. Understanding after making a good amount of effort is just fun.</p>

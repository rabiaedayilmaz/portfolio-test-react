                        student. Reading books and doing art are part of my life. Linguistics has always been
                        a big interest for me. I have interacted with mid-level Russian and Japanese, except my
                        so-believed advanced English. I have a great interest towards artificial intelligence and studying it.
                        Understanding after making a good amount of effort is just fun.</p>
